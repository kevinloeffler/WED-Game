# WED-Game
A Rock, Paper, Scissors game for the Web Design and Engineering 1 Course

### Feedback notes
1. Don't open the file locally. Either use Webstorm, or the link below to view the site (CORS Problems).
2. I've decided to implement the different hands / choices as a class. This makes the structure a bit unfamiliar but would allow to easily add more hands in the future.
3. The different choices (rock / paper / scissors) are not buttons because they contain images. But I've added the role="button" to comply with accessibility standards.
4. Prof. Stolze confirmed that although being bad practice, it is okay to omit semicolons.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
5. As you might tell I enjoyed working on this project, if you want to discuss my or your work more extensively just hit me up.

Thanks for reviewing my work :D
